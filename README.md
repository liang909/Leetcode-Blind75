### Question Link: 
https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions

### Language
When I was an undergraduate, I was more familiar with C++. However, because I'm currently learning more about data, this blind-75 I will write by Python. 

### Strategies 
##### Answer questions by category.
##### First: - Fast, Fast, Fast
I don't care if the solution is brute force and I don't care if I can figure it out. 
My purpose is to learn the type of questions and recall the knowledge. 
And, look at other people's answers to learn about good solutions.
##### Second: - Accuracy, proficiency, presentation
I had to immediately understand what the type was, what the logic was, how many ways there were to solve it, and what the time complexity.
Importantly, I had to learn to explain my thinking confidently, fluently, and professionally.
